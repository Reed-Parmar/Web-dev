        <pre>
            Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
            I leaned back on my radio
            Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll
            "Lotta soul, " he said
            Then the loud sound did seem to fade
            Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
            That wasn't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
            There's a starman waiting in the sky
            He'd like to come and meet us
            But he thinks he'd blow our minds
            There's a starman waiting in the sky
            He's told us not to blow it
            'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
            He told me
            Let the children lose it
            Let the children use it
            Let all the children boogie
            I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
            Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
            Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
            Look out your window, I can see his light
            If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
            Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
            There's a starman waiting in the sky
            He'd like to come and meet us
            But he thinks he'd blow our minds
            There's a starman waiting in the sky
            He's told us not to blow it
            'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
            He told me
            Let the children lose it
            Let the children use it
            Let all the children boogie
            Starman waiting in the sky
            He'd like to come and meet us
            But he thinks he'd blow our minds
            There's a starman waiting in the sky
            He's told us not to blow it
            'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
            He told me
            Let the children lose it
            Let the children use it
            Let all the children boogie
            La, la, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la

            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
            La, la, la, la
